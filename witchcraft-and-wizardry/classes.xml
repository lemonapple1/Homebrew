Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</p>

You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. If you don’t issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you gain one of the following features.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wizard's Best Friend.</em></strong> Your care and compassion towards creatures earns you their trust and respect. You can have a beast companion.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Prepared Ambush.</em></strong> In learning to combat dangerous targets, you know how to place a magical trap, waiting to be sprung. When you cast a spell that targets a single creature or area using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can weave that spell into your surroundings, having no immediate effect. The spell is cast when it is triggered by something, which you decide at the time of setting the trap, such as entering an area, getting within a certain distance, or manipulating an object. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the spell, such as specific people or those who say a certain password.</p>
			<p class="indent">Using this ability expends a spell slot two levels higher than the intended spell. For example, to set a 1st level spell as a magical trap, you must expend a 3rd level spell slot.</p>

For example, to set a 1st level spell as a magical trap, you must expend a 3rd level spell slot. If the spell requires a target, the spell can only target one triggering creature, or if it affects an area, the spell's area of effect is centered on the triggering creature. If the spell conjures hostile creatures, they appear as close as possible to the triggering creature and attack. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts its full duration. A trap can be detected by a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, or by casting specialis revelio.</p>
