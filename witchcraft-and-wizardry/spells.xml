The bond of light keeps the caster and target attached for the duration.</p>

				<li>If you target an area of stone or earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesnâ€™t have enough force to cause damage.</li>
				<li>If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. If cast multiple times, only two of this effect can be active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as a bonus action.</li>

		<description>
			<p>One small creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 15 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 100 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the targetâ€™s altitude by 5 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can't move up or down as part of your move, only 5 feet horizontally. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spellâ€™s range. When the spell ends, the target falls to the ground if it is still aloft. The creature then must succeed on an Dexterity saving throw or it will land prone regardless of whether it avoids damage from the fall.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the weight limit is increased by 150 pounds and range increased by 10 feet for each slot level above 0, and is no longer limited to small creatures.</p>

			<p>Often used as an investigative tool in wizarding crimes, this spell produces a ghostly recreation of the previous spell cast by the currently held wand. If the previously cast spell cannot be represented visually, you learn the incantation that was used, regardless of whether the incantation was spoken aloud at the time of casting. This spell can be cast a total of three consecutive times on a single wand, revealing the three most recently cast spells.</p>

			<p>This spell magically reverses any damage done to any objects or structures within a 5-foot cube, collecting all the pieces or components and reassembling them. Anything previously contained by the broken target, like a spilled liquid, is not placed back inside it. Anything affected by the breaking of the target, like a person who fell through a broken platform, is not undone. There is no effect on anything within the area that's undamaged, nor on anything damaged by time or decay.</p>
			<p>This spell can physically repair a magic item, but the spell canâ€™t restore magic to such an object.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cube's size increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

			<p>One willing, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, stunned or unconscious being of your choice that you can see within range rises 3 feet off the ground, and remains suspended there for the duration as if it were hoisted by invisible ropes under its arms. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. If more weight than the limit is placed on top of the being, the spell ends, and it falls to the ground.</p>
			<p class="indent">The being is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the being follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the object can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you move more than 100 feet from the being (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.</p>

			<p>Apparition is the method by which many adult witches and wizards choose to travel from place to place. When one apparates, they turn on the spot, "feeling [their] way into nothingness," and vanish from their present location to reappear a second later in a new location, accompanied by a loud cracking or popping sound.</p>
			<p>In order to apparate, you must have a proficiency bonus of +4 or greater; the process demands a certain level of magical skill that is beyond younger witches and wizards.</p>

			<h4>SIDE-ALONG APPARITION</h4>
			<p>When you apparate, you may bring along a number of creatures equal to your spell casting ability modifier</p>
			<p>If the creature is willing -2 on your apparition roll</p>
			<p>If the creature is unwilling you have disadvantage on your apparition roll</p>

			<h3>Apparition Roll</h3>
			<p>When attempting to apparate you must roll a d20 to check how well the apparition goes</p>
