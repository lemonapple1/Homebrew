	<element name="Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa)" type="Spell" source="Witchcraft and Wizardry" id="ID_WAW_SPELL_LEVITATION_CHARM">
		<supports>Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>One small creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 15 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 100 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by 5 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can't move up or down as part of your move, only 5 feet horizontally. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range. When the spell ends, the target falls to the ground if it is still aloft. The creature then must succeed on an Dexterity saving throw or it will land prone regardless of whether it avoids damage from the fall.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the weight limit is increased by 150 pounds and range increased by 10 feet for each slot level above 0, and is no longer limited to small creatures.</p>

			<p>Upon muttering the incantation, the tip of your wand sheds bright light in a narrow 15-foot cone and dim light for an additional 15 feet, much like a flashlight. The light is a bright white with a slight bluish tint. Completely covering the tip of your wand with something opaque blocks the light.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell ends if you dismiss it with the nox incantation, as a bonus action.</p>

			<p class="indent">If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.</p>

		<supports>Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell magically reverses any damage done to any objects or structures within a 5-foot cube, collecting all the pieces or components and reassembling them. Anything previously contained by the broken target, like a spilled liquid, is not placed back inside it. Anything affected by the breaking of the target, like a person who fell through a broken platform, is not undone. There is no effect on anything within the area that's undamaged, nor on anything damaged by time or decay.</p>
			<p>This spell can physically repair a magic item, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cube's size increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

			<p>An object is precisely torn or cut, as if a magical blade extended from the tip of your wand. Choose a target you can see within range that fits within a 5-foot cube. If the target is a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 3d4 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. This is the counterspell to incarcerous, immediately ending that spell's effects.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature or the cube's size increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st. If targeting additional creatures, the targets must be within 5 feet of each other when you target them.</p>

			<p>The spell throws a creature from its standing position to the ground with what feels like an invisible push. Choose a being you can see within range to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, is knocked back a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, is knocked back 5 feet, and isn’t knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the knockback on a failed save increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p>

			<p>You conjure a fire which shoots from you wand to a target you can see within range. Until the spells ends, the fire created fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the enchanted fire’s space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage.
