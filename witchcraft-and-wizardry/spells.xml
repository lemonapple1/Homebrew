		<supports>Caster</supports>
		<description>
			<p>One small creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 15 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 100 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by 5 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can't move up or down as part of your move, only 5 feet horizontally. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range. When the spell ends, the target falls to the ground if it is still aloft. The creature then must succeed on an Dexterity saving throw or it will land prone regardless of whether it avoids damage from the fall.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the weight limit is increased by 150 pounds and range increased by 10 feet for each slot level above 0, and is no longer limited to small creatures.</p>

			<p>You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:</p>

				<li>If you target an area of stone or earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.</li>
				<li>If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. If cast multiple times, only two of this effect can be active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as a bonus action.</li>

			<p>Often used as an investigative tool in wizarding crimes, this spell produces a ghostly recreation of the previous spell cast by the currently held wand. If the previously cast spell cannot be represented visually, you learn the incantation that was used, regardless of whether the incantation was spoken aloud at the time of casting. This spell can be cast a total of three consecutive times on a single wand, revealing the three most recently cast spells.</p>

			<p>You tap your wand on an object or area, revealing magical influences. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.</p>
			<p class="indent">If cast on an area, you learn what spells, if any, are currently active within a 5-foot cube in front of you. The border of each spell's effect is illuminated within that cube, much like blowing dust through laser beams.</p>

			<p>Apparition is the method by which many adult witches and wizards choose to travel from place to place. When one apparates, they turn on the spot, "feeling [their] way into nothingness," and vanish from their present location to reappear a second later in a new location, accompanied by a loud cracking or popping sound.</p>
			<p>In order to apparate, you must have a proficiency bonus of +4 or greater; the process demands a certain level of magical skill that is beyond younger witches and wizards.</p>

			<h4>SIDE-ALONG APPARITION</h4>
			<p>When you apparate, you may bring along a number of creatures equal to your spell casting ability modifier</p>
			<p>If the creature is willing -2 on your apparition roll</p>
			<p>If the creature is unwilling you have disadvantage on your apparition roll</p>

			<h3>Apparition Roll</h3>
			<p>When attempting to apparate you must roll a d20 to check how well the apparition goes</p>
