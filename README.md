# Homebrew


## Installation
To add a certain pack to your Aurora content, copy  
```xml
<file name="witchcraft-and-wizardry.index" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemonapple1/Homebrew/main/witchcraft-and-wizardry.index" />
```  
under `<files>` in `C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\5e Character Builder\custom\third-party.index`  

Then after launching Aurora, if the content has been loaded in, you may need to go to:  
Start > Additional Content > Clear Downloaded Content  
Start > Additional Content > Update Content Files  
And finally relaunch.
